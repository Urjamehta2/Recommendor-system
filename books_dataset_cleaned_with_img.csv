Umberto Eco,Hardcover,"In the course of the long debate on the nature and the classification of signs, from Boethius to Ockham, there are at least three lines of thought: the Stoic heritage, that influences Augustine, Abelard, Francis Bacon; the Aristotelian tradition, stemming from the commentaries on ,De Interpretatione;, the discussion of the grammarians, from Priscian to the Modistae. Modern interpreters are frequently misled by the fact that the various authors regularly used the same terms. Such a homogeneous terminology, however, covers profound theoretical differences. The aim of these essays is to show that the medieval theory of signs does not represent a unique body of semiotic notions: there are diverse and frequently alternative semiotic theories. This book thus represents an attempt to encourage further research on the still unrecognized variety of the semiotic approaches offered by the medieval philosophies of language.",History,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362957934l/1001231.jpg,9027232938,9.79E+12,0,4.1,0,On The Medieval Theory Of Signs,10,0.82,0.0,2.618263012898087e-06,0.0

James E. Faulconer,,"Faith, Philosophy, Scripture is a collection of 10 essays resulting from Professor James E. Faulconer s work as a philosopher and his abiding faith as a Latter-day Saint. Faith is the starting point, and philosophy is its supplement rather than competitor. Faulconer writes, The confidence of my faith, a confidence that came by revelation, has allowed me to hear the questions of philosophy without fear, and philosophy has never asked me to give up my faith, though it has asked questions about it. These essays ask what it means to remember (as our faith often calls us to do), how faith and reason are related to each other, what the place of theology is in revealed religion, and how we should think about scripture. The intent behind the book is to help the reader see how faith, philosophy, and scripture can be part of a whole life, each helping make sense of the others, with faith as the ground and center of them all.","Religion,Lds,Mormonism,Christianity,Lds",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312388020l/10124343.jpg,,9.76E+12,0,4.33,5,"Faith, Philosophy, Scripture",18,0.8660000000000001,3.149090542651282e-05,4.712873423216557e-06,0.0

Simon Sadler,Paperback,"The first book-length critical and historical account of an ultramodern architectural movement of the 1960s that advocated living equipment instead of buildings.,In the 1960s, the architects of Britain's Archigram group and Archigram magazine turned away from conventional architecture to propose cities that move and houses worn like suits of clothes. In drawings inspired by pop art and psychedelia, architecture floated away, tethered by wires, gantries, tubes, and trucks. In ,Archigram: Architecture without Architecture,, Simon Sadler argues that Archigram's sense of fun takes its place beside the other cultural agitants of the 1960s, originating attitudes and techniques that became standard for architects rethinking social space and building technology. The Archigram style was assembled from the Apollo missions, constructivism, biology, manufacturing, electronics, and popular culture, inspiring an architectural movement--High Tech--and influencing the postmodern and deconstructivist trends of the late twentieth century.,Although most Archigram projects were at the limits of possibility and remained unbuilt, the six architects at the center of the movement, Warren Chalk, Peter Cook, Dennis Crompton, David Greene, Ron Herron, and Michael Webb, became a focal point for the architectural avant-garde, because they redefined the purpose of architecture. Countering the habitual building practice of setting walls and spaces in place, Archigram architects wanted to provide the equipment for amplified living, and they welcomed any cultural rearrangements that would ensue. ,Archigram: Architecture without Architecture,--the first full-length critical and historical account of the Archigram phenomenon--traces Archigram from its rediscovery of early modernist verve through its courting of students, to its ascent to international notoriety for advocating the disappearance of architecture.","Architecture,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347920415l/1028877.jpg,262693224,262693224,252,4.02,1,Archigram: Architecture Without Architecture,45,0.8039999999999999,6.298181085302564e-06,1.1782183558041391e-05,0.0036

Zaenal Abidin bin Syamsudin,Hardcover,"Gelombang abad kebebasan dan badai globalisasi telah memporak-porandakan tatanan kehidupan negeri-negeri Islam. Hak asasi, demokrasi, emansipasi, kesetaraan gender telah menjadi kabut gelap di masyarakat. Fenomena â€keberanianâ€ wanita semakin meningkat,keharmonisan hidup berkeluarga pun semakin terancam! Kini, perceraian dianggap menjadi hal yang biasa. lstri menuntut cerai, itu menjadi hal yang lumrah. Bahkan tidak jarang, justru istri yang menceraikan suaminya. Padahal sesungguhnya, perceraian bukan hanya berdampak bagi kehidupan dunia, tapi justru kehidupan abadi, Akhirat!,Kenapa banyak Pasutri muslim gagal membina hubungan rumah tangga,padahal Islam sangat sempurna dalam mengusung konsep rumah tangga SAMARA? Fatamorgana hidup yang menyilaukan dan rayuan setan yang menyesatkan terkadang membuat Pasutri terlena dan lupa daratan, sehingga meninggalkan prinsip dan tujuan utama hidup. Seringkali, tujuan berubah menjadi sarana dan sarana menjadi tujuan, sehingga rumah tangga hancur berantakan. Inilah akibatnya jika dunia dan syahwat telah menjadi pengatur dan tolok ukur dalam memandang kesuksesan.,Di dalam buku mi, anda akan mendapatkan pencerahan dan pembelajaran yang sangat berharga dari beragam kasus dan kisah nyata yang sering menerpa kehidupan berumah tangga. Berbekal pengalaman,pengamatan dan pemahaman syariat Islam yang suci, maka penulis mencoba mengurai benang kusut yang sering membelit kehidupan Pasutri. Sehingga, buku ini layak menjadi pegangan bagi kita,sebagai rambu-rambu dalam mencari kebahagiaan di dunia dan mencari kenikmatan abadi di surga-Nya.,â€”,Perkara halal yang paling dibenci Allah adalah cerai, maka jangan memilih langkah perceraian kecuali dalam kondisi sangat mendesak dan darurat Begitu juga kaum wanita, jangan gampang menuntut cerai kecuali karena adanya alasan syarâ€™i. Dan di antara alasan seorang wanita boleh mengajukan tuntutan cerai, ketika sang suami tidak menunaikan hak-haknya secara wajar, sementara bila tetap hidup bersama, dirinya akan mengalami kehancuran.,Sebagian wanita ada yang mengambil jalan pintas untuk menyelesaikan problem rumah tangganya. la kurang berfikir panjang dan merenungkan dampaknya di kemudian hari. Maka dengan mudah ia dapat mengatakan â€œKalau Kau Jantan, Ceraikan Aku!â€,Kata-kata ini bisa meluluh-lantakkan bangunan rumah tangga dan mengoyak pondasi kehidupan. Dan Alloh Azza wa Jalla sangat murka dengan kata-kata itu kalau diucapkan tanpa alasan yang dibolehkan dalam syariat, karena demikian itu bisa menjauhkan wanita dari surga. Sebagaimana sabda Rosululloh Sholallahu Alaihi Wassalam:,â€œWanita mana saja yang meminta thalak kepada suaminya tanpa alasan, maka haram baginya aroma surga.â€ (HR. Abu Daud dan Tirmidzi sementara beliau meng-hasan-kannya),Ketika sang suami mendengar kata-kata emosional meluncur tajam dari mulut sang isteri; â€œKalau kau jantan, ceraikan aku sekarang juga!â€ Seorang suami yang cerdik dan bijak akan membalas kata-kata isterinya dengan senyum yang terindah, meskipun sedang menahan amarah. Lalu dengan kepala dingin dan penuh kelembutan, berkata: â€œSungguh, karena saya jantan, maka tidak mungkin menceraikanmu, sayang.â€,Berbagai macam faktor perceraian yang timbul di setiap rumah tangga, boleh jadi akibat keteledoran dari pihak suami atau pihak isteri, atau keluarga pihak suami atau keluarga pihak isteri, atau bahkan dari pihak luar yang ingin merusak ketentraman dan memperkeruh suasana bahagia. Namun sering kali semua pihak cenderung lepas tangan dan tidak mau bertanggung-jawab terhadap masalah yang timbul di tengah keluarga. Bahkan semua pihak tidak segan-segan mencari kambing hitam dan membenarkan dirinya sendiri.,Saat badai menggoncang dan bahtera rumah tangga pecah oleh perceraian, semua pihak baru tersadar. Akhirnya, kenyataan yang terjadi adalah sang isteri hidup merana dan anak-anak pun terlantar, sedangkan harapan untuk bersatu tidak lagi memungkinkan.,Sebagian materi pembahasan:,PEMBAHASAN PERTAMA: KALAU KAU JANTAN, CERAIKAN AKU !!, * Kalau Kamu Benar-benar Jantan, Ceraikan Aku Sekarang Juga!, * Mengenali Tabiat Buruk Wanita., * Wahai Kaum Wanita, Janganlah Mudah Menuntut Cerai., * Pahitnya Perceraian., * Alasan Tidak Cinta-Tidak Ada Kecocokkan, Cerai Dijatuhkan., * Cinta Butuh Pengorbanan., * Cemburu Buta, Penebar Bencana., * Jagalah Bentengmu Pasti Aman Istanamu., * Ingat!

W.S. Gilbert,Paperback,"(Vocal Score). This Gilbert & Sullivan opera is set in the Tower of London, during the 16th century, and is the darkest, and perhaps most emotionally engaging, of the Savoy Operas, ending with a broken-hearted main character and two very reluctant engagements, rather than the usual numerous marriages. The libretto does contain considerable humor, including a lot of pun-laden one-liners, but Gilbert's trademark satire and topsy-turvy plot complications are subdued in comparison with the other G&S operas.","Humor,Nonfiction,Plays",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387746854l/1067675.jpg,793553784,73999378603,244,3.83,8,Yeoman of the Guard,36,0.766,5.0385448682420515e-05,9.425746846433113e-06,0.0034857142857142856

Michael Steinberg,Paperback,"Enriched by biographical detail, historical background, musical examples, and many finely nuanced observations, this volume is a treasury of insight and information. Readers will find illuminating discussion of the complete symphonies of Beethoven, Schumann, Brahms, Sibelius, and Mahler, as well as of the most loved symphonic works of Schubert, Bruckner, Dvorak, Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev, and others.

This remarkable range and variety of composers are illuminated by Steinberg's deft, inviting, and intensely personal essays, which give such a vivid portrait of each composer's personality that the reader gets an immediate sense of how the work is a direct expression of the person from whose soul and brain it has sprung.,Tracing the ways in which composers have dealt with the musical challenges that have engaged them throughout the centuries, Steinberg takes us through the revolutions of expression, sound, and form that have shaped the symphony's remarkable history. Whether beginners or veterans, music lovers will listen to the symphony with enlivened interest and deeper understanding with Steinberg's masterful guide in hand.","Music,Nonfiction,Music,Classical Music,Reference,Art",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348567009l/109186.jpg,195126653,195126653,678,4.16,8,The Symphony: A Listener's Guide,79,0.8320000000000001,5.0385448682420515e-05,2.068427780189489e-05,0.009685714285714285
Martin  Walker,Hardcover,"In a brilliant and ambitious thriller that combines elements of Jean Auel's ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" and Ken Follett's ""The Pillars of the Earth"" into a riveting, multifaceted tale of love, art, courage, and war, Martin Walker brings to life the creation of an extraordinary work of prehistoric cave art and the struggle to possess it in our own time. Walker's richly interwoven novel opens with the arrival of a mysterious package for a young American woman working in a London auction house. Brought by a British officer, it contains a 17,000-year-old fragment of a cave painting left to him by his father, a former World War II hero.,The fragment, significant and stunning in itself, is also the key to the existence of an un-known cave that may be more important in the history of art and human creation than the world-famous one at Lascaux. It triggers a storm of publicity and commands the attention of the French authorities all the way up to the President of the Republic, who seems to know more about the painting's origins than anyone else...,As the young American woman, the British officer, and a French government art historian explore the ancient province of Perigord to determine the painting's origins, their search serves as backdrop for three compelling stories. There is the tale of the British officer's father who lands in Nazi-occupied France in 1944 to organize the Resistance, culminating in a series of battles to prevent the SS Das Reich Panzer Division from reaching the Normandy beaches in time to repel the D-Day invasion, which leads to an account of the subsequent discovery -- and cover-up -- of the lost cave and its paintings. And there is also the moving storyof the young artist who painted them, the woman he loved, and the ancient culture that produced the first recognizable human art but required the sacrifice of its own creators.,Filled with vivid, historically accurate details and imaginative re-creations of prehistoric life, ""The Caves of Perigord"" blends a complex plot and richly diverse characters into a seamless narrative of romance, tragedy, and heroism from past to present.","Historical,Historical Fiction,Mystery,Fiction,Cultural,France,Thriller,Thriller,Mystery Thriller,War,Historical,Audiobook,Mystery,Crime",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1373310670l/1093661.jpg,743222849,9.78E+11,378,3.89,149,The Caves of Perigord,1233,0.778,0.0009384289817100821,0.00032283182949033415,0.0054

"Hal Lindsey,Carole C. Carlson",Paperback,"No one thinks much about the Devil anymore. In fact, words like witchcraft and black magic have a strangely medieval ring to our ears. Many people even think of Satan as somehow comic -- and therefore harmless. Yet amidst the tragedy and corruption of our own century, it is ironic that many people doubt whether an active, evil force really exists. But Satan is not dead, says author Hal Lindsey; he has simply adopted a more modern style. Spiritualism, astrology, ""new age"" religion -- all of these and more are signs of the creeping influence of the Father of Lies in our time. In this book, Hal Lindsey, well-known speaker and author of the best-selling Late Great Planet Earth, outlines a battle plan for overcoming this very real and insidious enemy.

LeRoy Eims,Paperback,"""Every believer in Jesus Christ deserves the opportunity of personal nurture and development."" says LeRoy Eims. But all too often the opportunity isn't there. We neglect the young Christian in our whirl of programs, church services, and fellowship groups. And we neglect to raise up workers and leaders who can disciple young believers into mature and fruitful Christians. In simple, practical, and biblical terms, LeRoy Eims revives the lost art of disciple making.

David Hackett Fischer,Hardcover,"Six months after the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolution was all but lost. A powerful British force had routed the Americans at New York, occupied three colonies, and advanced within sight of Philadelphia.,Yet, as David Hackett Fischer recounts in this riveting history, George Washington--and many other Americans--refused to let the Revolution die. On Christmas night, as a howling nor'easter struck the Delaware Valley, he led his men across the river and attacked the exhausted Hessian garrison at,Trenton, killing or capturing nearly a thousand men. A second battle of Trenton followed within days. The Americans held off a counterattack by Lord Cornwallis's best troops, then were almost trapped by the British force. Under cover of night, Washington's men stole behind the enemy and struck them,again, defeating a brigade at Princeton. The British were badly shaken. In twelve weeks of winter fighting, their army suffered severe damage, their hold on New Jersey was broken, and their strategy was ruined.,Fischer's richly textured narrative reveals the crucial role of contingency in these events. We see how the campaign unfolded in a sequence of difficult choices by many actors, from generals to civilians, on both sides. While British and German forces remained rigid and hierarchical, Americans,evolved an open and flexible system that was fundamental to their success. The startling success of Washington and his compatriots not only saved the faltering American Revolution, but helped to give it new meaning.","History,Nonfiction,North American Hi...,American History,Military History,American Revolution,American Revolution,American Revolutionary War,War,Military,Military History,Biography,Politics,Presidents,War,Military Fiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1353284022l/1206073.jpg,195170342,195170342,564,4.14,432,Washington's Crossing,14088,0.828,0.0027208142288507077,0.003688608932570825,0.008057142857142856

Maarten 't Hart,Paperback,"Toen Maarten 't Hart acht jaar oud was, hoorde hij 'Wohl mir, dass ich Jesum habe' uit cantate 147 in de befaamde pianobewerking van Myra Hess. Het was het mooiste wat hij ooit gehoord had, en sindsdien is hij een hartstochtelijk bewonderaar van Johann Sebastian Bach. Bach is zijn oudste, diepste, grootste liefde. Zelfs Mozart die hij toch ook onvoorwaardelijk bewondert, neemt in zijn hart niet zo'n grote plaats in als Bach. Dat is ook te danken aan het feit dat hij zich iedere dag aan de piano laaft aan de springlevende geest van dit onvergankelijke genie. In dit boek bespreekt hij een aantal biografische onduidelijkheden in het leven van Bach, probeert hij aan te tonen dat Bach rond 1730 in een crisis geraakte vanwege huishoudelijke omstandigheden, geeft hij zijn visie op de cantates, de concerten, het Wohltemperierte Klavier, de andere klaviermuziek, de MatthÃ¤uspassion, de kamermuziek, en op de omvangrijke literatuur over het fenomeen Bach.","Music,Nonfiction,Art,Biography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312732422l/12316232.jpg,9029521872,5.03E+12,199,3.22,12,Johann Sebastian Bach,87,0.6440000000000001,7.557817302363077e-05,2.2778888212213358e-05,0.0028428571428571426

Chantal Maillard,,"Husos es una teorÃ­a de la mente que se construye con el material de la propia vida; una topografÃ­a de los espacios mentales en los que se ubican las emociones y los estados de Ã¡nimo, reducidos a connotaciones sintomÃ¡ticas de imÃ¡genes mÃ¡s o menos perdurables. El observador, ya presente en los Diarios indios, aquÃ­, en una vuelta de tuerca mÃ¡s, va elaborando el mÃ©todo. Un mÃ©todo para ver, para controlar, sus fisuras. Sus sedimentos, tambiÃ©n: el magma de la memoria y, por supuesto, sus fluctuaciones. Su voz es la de una conciencia que atienda a sus propias idas y venidas, una voz entrecortada por la inmediatez de la experiencia y la voluntad de hacerla aparecer en la escritura. Es Ã©sta una escritura cada vez mÃ¡s resistente a plegarse a las formas convenidas, extraÃ±ada del lastre que arrastran sus conceptos, obligada a desactivarlos hasta el balbuceo. Sin embargo, es tambiÃ©n, para el observador, la Ãºnica herramienta, la que trazando puentes entre los husos, haciÃ©ndolos porosos, le salva de quedar atrapado en cualquiera de ellos y le permite situarse en un lugar de neutralidad donde la actividad de la mente, ese haz de husos tensos, queda suspendida. O Â¿serÃ¡ Ã©sta otra ilusiÃ³n? â€œÂ¿CuÃ¡l es el huso del observador?â€, pregunta el observador.,En el sistema de resonancias que se establece entre la voz principal y las Notas al margen, y en la infracciÃ³n de sus lÃ­mites, que son tambiÃ©n los del lenguaje y sus gÃ©neros, se desenvuelve la pregunta. Ese espacio de reconocimiento es la razÃ³n de ser de una escritura que, mÃ¡s allÃ¡ del vÃ©rtigo, se expone y da cuenta de sÃ­ misma. La teorÃ­a del conocimiento acaba siendo, a la postre, una novedosa indagaciÃ³n sobre los lÃ­mites del lenguaje.","Poetry,European Literature,Spanish Literature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1314362401l/12442422.jpg,,8.48E+12,100,4.36,0,Husos,22,0.8720000000000001,0.0,5.7601786283757916e-06,0.0014285714285714286

Once he secures a working battery, he discovers a story penned by Sam Devine, a hacker who led a rebellion against the insane corporation BCM thirty years before.,Sam works for BCM out of necessity rather than choice. He despises the company for its lack of ethics and knows the best way to destroy it is from within.

AndrÃ© Frossard,Paperback,"The famous French author's unique writing style captivates the reader with the heroic story of Saint Maximilian Kolbe, a modern apostle of Catholic evangelization, Marian spirituality, and a martyr of charity. With the encouragement of Pope John Paul II and the help of documentation (some unpublished) given to him by the Vatican, Frossard chronicles the dramatic and moving life of this Polish Franciscan who volunteered to die in place of a fellow prisoner in Auschwitz.,While his heroic martyr's death is well known, Frossard shows how Kolbe's whole life was one of extraordinary generosity in devotion to his ideal of ""love without limits."" Kolbe was that rare combination of mystic, intellectual genius, theologian, and down-to-earth practicality. His tremendous creative energies (despite constant bouts of tuberculosis and less than one lung) enhanced the lives of all those who knew him, the millions who read his publications, and the countless persons inspired by his example.Â ,Forget Not Love,Â reveals the interesting and impressive details of Kolbe's childhood, vision of Mary, brilliance in his studies, his founding of the largest monastery in the world (700 Franciscans), massive printing apostolate, missionary journeys to Japan, and his final act of love in Auschwitz. Frossard has captured the heart of the man whom Pope John Paul II declared ""the patron saint of this difficult century.""","Christianity,Catholic,Religion,Biography,Religion,Faith,War,World War II,War,Spirituality,History,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347779883l/1296972.jpg,898702755,8987027553,199,4.12,12,Forget Not Love: The Passion of Maximilian Kolbe,98,0.8240000000000001,7.557817302363077e-05,2.5658977526401253e-05,0.0028428571428571426

William J.  Cook,Hardcover,"The story of one of the greatest unsolved problems in mathematics,What is the shortest possible route for a traveling salesman seeking to visit each city on a list exactly once and return to his city of origin? It sounds simple enough, yet the traveling salesman problem is one of the most intensely studied puzzles in applied mathematics--and it has defied solution to this day. In this book, William Cook takes readers on a mathematical excursion, picking up the salesman's trail in the 1800s when Irish mathematician W. R. Hamilton first defined the problem, and venturing to the furthest limits of today's state-of-the-art attempts to solve it. He also explores its many important applications, from genome sequencing and designing computer processors to arranging music and hunting for planets.,In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman, travels to the very threshold of our understanding about the nature of complexity, and challenges you yourself to discover the solution to this captivating mathematical problem.","Science,Mathematics,Science,Computer Science,Nonfiction,Science,Computer Science,Programming",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347773122l/13096510.jpg,691152705,691152705,228,3.89,20,In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman: Mathematics at the Limits of Computation,179,0.778,0.0001259636217060513,4.686690793087576e-05,0.003257142857142857

Neagu Djuvara,Paperback,"Ce au fost â€žboierii mariâ€œ Ã®n Å¢ara RomÃ¢neascÄƒ? Saga GrÄƒdiÅŸtenilor ,este o cercetare asupra unei familii boiereÅŸti ÅŸi, Ã®n fapt, un volum ce priveÅŸte istoria instituÅ£iilor politice romÃ¢neÅŸti premoderne. FÄƒrÄƒ tagadÄƒ, aÅŸa cum reiese din minunata demonstraÅ£ie a autorului, istoria boierimii romÃ¢ne atinge Ã®ncontinuu istoria politicÄƒ a principatelor, deoarece marea boierime a jucat un rol foarte Ã®nsemnat â€“ ba chiar dominant Ã®n guvernarea Å£Äƒrii, dinainte de â€ždescÄƒlecÄƒtoriâ€œ ÅŸi pÃ¢nÄƒ la naÅŸterea RomÃ¢niei moderne. Vom descoperi Ã®n ce fel marile familii boiereÅŸti ÅŸi-au dobÃ¢ndit sau ÅŸi-au pierdut moÅŸiile ÅŸi, odatÄƒ cu averile, privilegiile politice ÅŸi dregÄƒtoriile Ã®nalte. Cum au fost rÃ¢nd pe rÃ¢nd ÅŸi mai mult sau mai puÅ£in conÅŸtient, agenÅ£ii aproape exclusivi a trei influenÅ£e strÄƒine, determinante Ã®n domeniul culturii: cea slavonÄƒ, Ã®n primele timpuri ale Evului nostru Mediu, cea greacÄƒ, apoi turco-fanariotÄƒ, Ã®n secolele XVII-XVIII, la urmÄƒ cea francezÄƒ Ã®n secolul al XIX-lea ÅŸi Ã®nceputul celui de al XX-lea. Cum au Ã®ncheiat alianÅ£e de familie, puternic marcate de endogamie, pentru a conserva rangurile ÅŸi din nou averile. Cum femeile, adesea aprige, au jucat un rol Ã®nsemnat Ã®n transmiterea numelui. Cum ei, boierii, au fost promotorii modernizÄƒrii RomÃ¢niei ca revoluÅ£ionari, reformatori, oameni politici.

Steven M. Kay,Hardcover,"The most comprehensive overview of signal detection available. This is a thorough, up-to-date introduction to optimizing detection algorithms for implementation on digital computers. It focuses extensively on real-world signal processing applications, including state-of-the-art speech and communications technology as well as traditional sonar/radar systems. Start with a quick review of the fundamental issues associated with mathematical detection, as well as the most important probability density functions and their properties. Next, review Gaussian, Chi-Squared, F, Rayleigh, and Rician PDFs, quadratic forms of Gaussian random variables, asymptotic Gaussian PDFs, and Monte Carlo Performance Evaluations. Three chapters introduce the basics of detection based on simple hypothesis testing, including the Neyman-Pearson Theorem, handling irrelevant data, Bayes Risk, multiple hypothesis testing, and both deterministic and random signals. The author then presents exceptionally detailed coverage of composite hypothesis testing to accommodate unknown signal and noise parameters. These chapters will be especially useful for those building detectors that must work with real, physical data. Other topics covered include:,Detection in nonGaussian noise, including nonGaussian noise characteristics, known deterministic signals, and deterministic signals with unknown parameters,Detection of model changes, including maneuver detection and time-varying PSD detection,Complex extensions, vector generalization, and array processing The book makes extensive use of MATLAB, and program listings are included wherever appropriate.

She also reminds us of the need to be disciplined and to avoid being sidetracked by those little distractions -- for example, you might hold off on checking your email in the morning until you've written at least three pages.,
  ,
,In relation to character development in fiction, the author points out that a good plot complication will either thwart or alter the character's desire. She reminds you to instill your characters with life. And, she offers an extremely useful tool -- using differently colored markers to highlight action, reflection, and dialogue in your prose. This ingenious technique will assist you in knowing when you are telling rather than showing and will allow you to create vivid action that will involve the reader in your characters and plot. All in all, Wood has authored an innovative, inspirational pocket muse that is produced in a handy carry-along size and is so unique it doesn't even require numbered pages. It is all about inspiration, digging deep, and keeping the faith as you spin out prose that will long be remembered. ,(Evie Rhodes)","Language,Writing,Nonfiction,Reference,Poetry,Self Help,Unfinished,Adult,Academic,Art,Crafts",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388493044l/139606.jpg,1582973229,35313109584,256,4.01,68,The Pocket Muse: Ideas and Inspirations for Writing,1101,0.802,0.0004282763138005744,0.00028827075772007936,0.003657142857142857

C. John Miller,Paperback,"This is a book for pacesetters -- church leaders who desire to help their churches break free of the things that turn them in on themselves and keep them from being outward-looking and outward-moving communities of Jesus Christ. The ingrown church is a common phenomenon. It is the ""norm"" for contemporary evangelical and Protestant churches. But ingrownness is a pathology. It can destroy the vital spiritual health of a church. It must, therefore, be combated with the norms of Scripture. And that is why this book was written. Outgrowing the Ingrown Church is a masterful mix of biblical principle, objective analysis, and personal experience. It traces the author's own growing awareness of the problem of ingrownness in his calling as a pastor, seminary professor, and evangelist/missionary. In his own discovery of the power and presence of God he discovered the tendency of the church to live by its own power and resources. This is a book written to help change churches by changing the individuals who read it. It offers one an unparalleled challenge to be evaluated, revitalized, and then used by God for the work of ministry. Thus it is a book not merely for pastors, but for the whole body of Christ. ""I have never been as excited about any book concerning church growth as when I read this book . . . . (His biblical) principles, if followed, transform individual lives and then lead to a movement within a church to change the whole congregation,"" writes John Guest in the foreword.","Religion,Church,Christianity,Evangelism,Religion,Theology,Christianity,Ecclesiology,Nonfiction,Leadership,Christian,Religion,Christianity",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1381324608l/1529143.jpg,310284112,25986284114,176,4.07,25,Outgrowing the Ingrown Church,131,0.8140000000000001,0.00015745452713256412,3.429924546896494e-05,0.002514285714285714

However, in Loteria instead of matching up numbers on a game board, players match up images.,There are 54 cards in the LoterÃ­a game, and for this short story collection you will find one unique story per card based on a Latin American myth, folklore, superstition, or belief â€“ with a slant towards the paranormal and horrific. In this deck of cards you will find murderers, ghosts, goblins and ghouls. This collection features creatures and monsters, vampires and werewolves and many of these legends existed in the Americas long before their European counterparts.,Many of these stories have been passed over time throughout the Americas, and many have been passed via word of mouth, just like the tales the Brothers Grimm collected.

Dan     Hill,Kindle Edition,"We live in an age of sticky problems, whether itâ€™s climate change or the decline of the welfare state. With conventional solutions failing, a new culture of decision-making is called for. Strategic design is about applying the principles of traditional design to ""big picture"" systemic challenges such as healthcare, education and the environment. It redefines how problems are approached and aims to deliver more resilient solutions. In this short book, Dan Hill outlines a new vocabulary of design, one that needs to be smuggled into the upper echelons of power. He asserts that, increasingly, effective design means engaging with the messy politics â€“ the â€œdark matterâ€ â€“ taking place above the designerâ€™s head. And that may mean redesigning the organisation that hires you.","Design,Nonfiction,Business,Philosophy,Architecture",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344382263l/15801041.jpg,,B0085KEVO8,86,4.34,22,Dark Matter and Trojan Horses: A Strategic Design Vocabulary,162,0.868,0.00013855998387665643,4.241586080894901e-05,0.0012285714285714285

Bessie James,Kindle Edition,"Bessie is my lover. She is a â€œprostituteâ€ but thatâ€™s not important to me. At age thirty-five, she decided to find out if she could be really great at having sex with strangers for money. At the beginning of â€œIntimate Acts with Strangersâ€ she is thirty-seven, and is, indeed, really great at having sex for money. These 359 pages document how she came to be one of the most celebrated escorts in Seattle. ,At the same time, Bessie is also the mother of three young children. She lives with her husband and kids in a middle-class suburb of Seattle. She could be your neighbor that does creative craft projects with your kids on her kitchen table when they come over for a â€œplay date.â€ There could be someone just like her living next door to you. ,She could even be you.,The main questions this book addresses are: Why do so many married men pay for sex? And what are the realities of the apartment-based sex providers who sell it to them? â€œIntimate Acts with Strangersâ€ gives you a rare insight into the motivations behind these seemingly cold transactions., ,Despite some extremely erotic and playful scenes, this book ends up being a very serious document about the unfairness of the way prostitutes (and their clients) are regarded and a raw, hopefully inspiring journey of two people exploring their sexual liberation. Once youâ€™ve read it, you may love it or you may hate it, but more importantly, you should talk about why it affected you the way it did.,There are hundreds of thousands of women like Bessie all over America, but the mass media hasnâ€™t a clue what their lives are really like. When the Bessies of America read this book, theyâ€™ll say, â€œAt last, someone portrays what really goes on behind my apartment door.â€, ,Youâ€™ll say, â€œAt last I know why those apartment doors exist.â€,We should warn you, though: there is real trouble ahead for all of us -- Bessie, me, and yes, even you, intrepid reader. Our senses of propriety, our sexual boundaries and our notions of true love are all on the line here., ,Bessie and I would not have gone to the trouble of opening up our complicated lives to you if we didnâ€™t want to put more great sex into the world. But at the same time, we want something more from your reading our story. As one Goodreads reviewer put it â€œThis is a true love story! Real life synchronicity, the universe moving two people into alignment against all odds.â€ ,Great sex makes a lot of trouble almost worthwhile.

Gabor S. Boritt,Paperback,"After the Civil War, someone asked General Pickett why the Battle of Gettysburg had been lost: Was it Lee's error in taking the offensive, the tardiness of Ewell and Early, or Longstreet's hesitation in attacking? Pickett scratched his head and replied, I've always thought the Yankees had something to do with it. This simple fact, writes James McPherson, has escaped a generation of historians who have looked to faulty morale, population, economics, and dissent as the causes of Confederate failure. These were all factors, he writes, but the Civil War was still a war--won by the Union army through key victories at key moments.,With this brilliant review of how historians have explained the Southern defeat, McPherson opens a fascinating account by several leading historians of how the Union broke the Confederate rebellion. In every chapter, the military struggle takes center stage, as the authors reveal how battlefield decisions shaped the very forces that many scholars (putting the cart before the horse) claim determined the outcome of the war. Archer Jones examines the strategy of the two sides, showing how each had to match its military planning to political necessity. Lee raided north of the Potomac with one eye on European recognition and the other on Northern public opinion--but his inevitable retreats looked like failure to the Southern public. The North, however, developed a strategy of deep raids that was extremely effective because it served a valuable political as well as military purpose, shattering Southern morale by tearing up the interior. Gary Gallagher takes a hard look at the role of generals, narrowing his focus to the crucial triumvirate of Lee, Grant, and Sherman, who towered above the others. Lee's aggressiveness may have been costly, but he well knew the political impact of his spectacular victories; Grant and Sherman, meanwhile, were the first Union generals to fully harness Northern resources and carry out coordinated campaigns. Reid Mitchell shows how the Union's advantage in numbers was enhanced by a dedication and perseverance of federal troops that was not matched by the Confederates after their home front began to collapse. And Joseph Glatthaar examines black troops, whose role is entering the realm of national myth.,In 1960, there appeared a collection of essays by major historians, entitled ,Why the North Won the Civil War,, edited by David Donald; it is now in its twenty-sixth printing, having sold well over 100,000 copies. ,Why the Confederacy Lost, provides a parallel volume, written by today's leading authorities. Provocatively argued and engagingly written, this work reminds us that the hard-won triumph of the North was far from inevitable.","Military History,Civil War,History,American History,American Civil War,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348356822l/160365.jpg,195085493,195085493,224,3.61,7,Why the Confederacy Lost,128,0.722,4.408726759711795e-05,3.3513766565095515e-05,0.0031999999999999997

Howard Rheingold,Kindle Edition,"Instead of asking whether the Web is making us stupid, Howard Rheingold turns that question around and asks how designing and using digital media mindfully could make us smarter. What if humans could build tools that leverage our ability to think, communicate, and cooperate? Humans invented social learning, speech, writing, alphabets, printing, computers, and the Internet, which means we should be systematically directing the evolution of intellectual augmentation. Mind Amplifier: Can Our Digital Tools Make Us Smarter? examines the origins of digital mind-extending tools, and then lays out the foundations for their future. Rheingold proposes an applied, interdisciplinary science of mind amplification.

Eugenio Corti,Hardcover,"Eugenio Corti A literary phenomenon in Italy, The Red Horse a European bast-seller, was voted the best Italian novel of the decade in a public survey. Its success had gone far beyond Italy, as the book has been translated into Spanish, French, Japanese and three other languages. This epic historical novel about World War II and after, written from the author's own personal experiences as an Italian Freedom Fighter, is a profoundly moving account of the war, those who fought in it on both sides, and the effects the war had on families in the author's hometown in Italy. On a wider scale, it is a faithful witness to the actual events of the war - including the role of historical personages who appear, the Russian campaign, the Nazi barbarism, the Communist gulag, the North Italian resistance, and political life in the two decades following the war. This world, filled with powerful personalities, drama and clashing armies, bathes in the light of the truth. What makes this truly historical novel, with its epic scope, a masterpiece is the underlying spiritual dimensions of the protagonist, his family and friends, which illuminates the ongoing tragedy of the war and its aftermath. In the end, it is a story of faith and hope in a world reduced to barbarism and cruelty. Born in 1921 in Lombardy, Eugenio Corti joined the Italian Freedom Fighters. From his experiences of the tragic retreat from Russia, Corti wrote a fascinating chronicle, Most Did Not Return, and a book about the Italian Freedom Fighters, The Last Soldiers of the King.","Historical,Historical Fiction,Fiction,War,World War II,War,Historical,Novels,Literature,Literature,20th Century,Classics,European Literature,Italian Literature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349005956l/1658360.jpg,898709342,8987093428,1015,4.22,45,The Red Horse,237,0.844,0.0002834181488386154,6.205283340568467e-05,0.014499999999999999

Amid the chaos, one man experiences a terminal affliction, a revolution of the self: the chronic transformation into the city of Kyoto, Japan. Each transformation further plunges the world into darkness, but heâ€™s helpless against the lethal clockwork of his body, his psyche, his mindscreensâ€”and nothing, not even Fate itself, can stop him from becoming God ...

"William Lane Craig,Walter Sinnott-Armstrong",Paperback,"The question of whether or not God exists is profoundly fascinating and important. Now two articulate spokesmen--one a Christian, the other an atheist--duel over God's existence in an illuminating battle of ideas. , In ,God? A Debate between a Christian and an Atheist,, William Lane Craig and Walter Sinnott-Armstrong bring to the printed page two debates they held before live audiences, preserving all the wit, clarity, and immediacy of their public exchanges. Avoiding overly esoteric arguments, they directly address issues such as religious experience, the Bible, evil, eternity, the origin of the universe, design, and the supposed connection between morality and the existence of God. Employing sharp and humorous arguments, each philosopher strikes quickly to the heart of his opponent's case. For example, Craig claims that we must believe in God in order to explain objective moral values, such as why rape is wrong. Sinnott-Armstrong responds that what makes rape wrong is the harm to victims of rape, so rape is immoral even if there is no God. By assuming a traditional concept of God in their discussion, the authors ensure that they are truly addressing each other's viewpoints and engaging in a disagreement over a unified issue. The book is composed of six chapters that alternate between Craig and Sinnott-Armstrong, so that each separate point can be discussed as it arises. Ideal for courses in the philosophy of religion and introduction to philosophy, this lively and direct dialogue will stimulate students and anyone interested in the existence of God, regardless of whether or not they believe in God.","Philosophy,Religion,Nonfiction,Religion,Theology,Religion,Atheism,Christian,Science,Religion,Christianity,Religion,God",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348437745l/173129.jpg,195166000,195166000,156,3.73,29,God?: A Debate between a Christian and an Atheist,283,0.746,0.00018264725147377437,7.409684326501587e-05,0.0022285714285714287
